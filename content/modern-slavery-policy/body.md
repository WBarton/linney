# Modern slavery policy

**Financial year ending April 2020**

## Introduction

Slavery is illegal and a violation of human rights. Slavery can occur in various forms including forced labour, child labour, exploitation, being controlled by an employer, debt bondage, being physically constrained, being sold or treated as a commodity and having restrictions on freedom of movement. These acts involve the deprivation of a person’s liberty by another in order to exploit them for personal or commercial gain.

## Business and Structure

W & J Linney Limited is a UK-based marketing services provider operating primarily in the UK and Europe with 1036 employees and an annual turnover of £100m.

## Policy

We have a zero-tolerance approach to slavery. We are committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business dealings and relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure slavery is not taking place anywhere in our own business or those of our suppliers.

The prevention, detection and reporting of slavery in any part of our organisation or supply chains is the responsibility of all those working for us. Employees are required to avoid any activity that might lead to, or suggest, a breach of this policy. Employees are encouraged to raise concerns about any issue or suspicion of slavery in any part of our organisation or supply chains at the earliest possible stage. This policy does not form part of any employee’s contract of employment and we may amend it at any time.

## Supply Chain

We work in partnership with all our contractors, suppliers and other business partners to ensure that they share and work towards the same values we hold against slavery and human trafficking. As part of our selection and management programme, suppliers are required to make an anti-slavery declaration.

## High Risk Areas

Our operations are based in the UK and Europe, as are those of our suppliers. However, we do have a small number of suppliers whose supply chains reach into higher risk areas. We actively work with these suppliers to identify and address risks of slavery and human trafficking.

## Awareness and Performance Indicators

Modern Slavery awareness will be included in our core values training packs for all employees and also be available on our intranet. We will record and measure any violations of this policy and information relating to slavery and human trafficking reported by our employees, suppliers or members of the public.

## Responsibility

The board of directors are responsible for this policy in line with the Modern Slavery Act 2015.
