# Linney: Gender Pay Gap Report

As a company with 250+ employees, the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017 requires Linney to publish specific gender pay gap information.

The following figures are taken from the pay period up to April 2018\. They include financial jargon you may be unfamiliar with.

**So, here’s your guide to some of the terms we’ll be using.**

**Gender pay** The gender pay gap compares a simple average of the pay of full-time male and female Linney employees. The gender pay gap is different to **equal pay**, which takes into account the nature and seniority of a role.

**Mean figure** This is the difference between the average of men’s and women’s pay.

**Median figure** This is the difference between the midpoints in the ranges of men’s and women’s pay.

**OUR FIGURES**

These are the figures the regulations require us to report:

Mean gender pay gap in hourly rate **14.74%**

Median gender pay gap in hourly rate **17.24%**

Mean bonus gender pay gap **-8.93%**

Median bonus gender pay gap **6.34%**

Proportion of males and females receiving a bonus payment

**Male 5.95%**

**Female 3.17%**

Proportion (%) of males and females in each pay quartile

**                                       Male    Female**

Upper                           68          32

Middle Upper          67          33

Middle Lower          53          47

Lower                           51          49

However, we’re not interested in meeting minimum requirements – either in terms of delivering for our clients or sharing information with our colleagues. So, we’ve compiled more statistics in an attempt to paint an even clearer picture of gender pay at Linney.

Mean gender pay gap in hourly rate per quartile

Upper quartile **6.36%**

Upper mid quartile **2.41%**

Lower mid quartile **2.0%**

Lower quartile **-0.1%**

Historically, core elements of Linney’s manufacturing process – such as print and fulfilment – have been male dominated disciplines. This is true of similar businesses around the world.

However, Linney’s growth and diversification over the past decade has resulted in an increase in female employees across all quartiles and every discipline – creative, administrative, manufacturing and fulfilment.

**I confirm that the information contained within this report is accurate.**
